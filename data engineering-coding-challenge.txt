How you will be judged:

You will be scored on,
-coding standard, comments and style
-unit testing strategy
-overall solution design
-appropriate use of source control

Instructions

Candidate should put their test results on a public code repository hosted on Github
Once test is completed please share the Github repository URL to hiring team so they can review your work.
Create a solution that crawls for fashion products information, stores in a PostGRESQL database.
Bonus points:
- if you store the data on an AWS RDS
- if you are able to deploy the scraper using AWS dockers

Details
Write an application to crawl an online fashion brand website, e.g. https://www.fordays.com, https://www.reformation.com or https://www.zara.com using a crawler framework such as Selenium, bs4, etc. You can use a crawl framework of your choice in Python. (YOU ONLY NEED TO SCRAPE A FEW PRODUCTS, not entire website, however, please explain your strategy to scrape the whole website, extract all the URLs and update the database automatically overtime (new products, update old products not available anymore)

this is an example of how the extracted information should be structured:

display_name (str)
product_material (str)
color (str)
size (list)
price (str)
product_url (str)
image_links (list)
brand_name (str)
description (str)
scrapped_date (date)
low_level (str) [category of clothes: e.g. casual pants, dress]
gender (str) [men, women, or kids]
secondhand (bool) [is it from a second hand retailer, already worn?]


Store the data in a hosted PostGRES database.
